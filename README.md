# hw1-knn
HW1: k-Nearest Neighbors

This assignment contains four data sets which are based on three publicly available benchmarks:

1. monks1.csv: A data set describing two classes of robots using all nominal attributes and a binary label.  This data set has a simple rule set for determining the label: if head_shape = body_shape  jacket_color = red, then yes, else no. Each of the attributes in the monks1 data set are nominal.  Monks1 was one of the first machine learning challenge problems (http://www.mli.gmu.edu/papers/91-95/91-28.pdf).  This data set comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/MONK%27s+Problems

2. penguins.csv: A data set describing observed measurements of different animals belonging to three species of penguins.  The four attributes are each continuous measurements, and the label is the species of penguin.  Special thanks and credit to Professor Allison Horst at the University of California Santa Barbara for making this data set public: see this Twitter post and thread with more information (https://twitter.com/allison_horst/status/1270046399418138625) and GitHub repository (https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins).

3. mnist_100.csv: A data set of optical character recognition of numeric digits from images.  Each instance represents a different grayscale 28x28 pixel image of a handwritten numeric digit (from 0 through 9).  The attributes are the intensity values of the 784 pixels. Each attribute is ordinal (treat them as continuous for the purpose of this assignment) and a nominal label.  This version of MNIST contains 100 instances of each handwritten numeric digit, randomly sampled from the original training data for MNIST.  The overall MNIST data set is one of the main benchmarks in machine learning: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.  It was converted to CSV file using the python code provided at: https://quickgrid.blogspot.com/2017/05/Converting-MNIST-Handwritten-Digits-Dataset-into-CSV-with-Sorting-and-Extracting-Labels-and-Features-into-Different-CSV-using-Python.html

4. mnist_1000.csv: The same as mnist_100, except containing 1000 instances of each handwritten numeric digit.
